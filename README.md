# 02267-SoftwareDevelopmentOfWebServices
This is the code base from the group Kolkata in course 02267 Software Development of Web Services cloned into new Git repo for further
changes. The reason for not making the changes in the original git repository is that the course has finished and I (frksteenhoff) wanted to further improve the logic for personal development reasons. 

Original git repository is found here: https://repos.gbar.dtu.dk/git/s123807/Kolkata.git
